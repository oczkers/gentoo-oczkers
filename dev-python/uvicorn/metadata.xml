  <longdescription lang="en">
Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.

Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application interface for asyncio frameworks. The ASGI specification fills this gap, and means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling usable across all asyncio frameworks.

Uvicorn currently supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets. Support for HTTP/2 is planned.
